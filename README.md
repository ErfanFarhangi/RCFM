# RCFM

A Game-Theoretic Approach to Energy-EfficientElevator Scheduling in Smart Buildings

The source code for an energy-efficient elevator scheduling algorithm for smart buildings, called RCFM, is provided, which is based on coalitional game theory capturing interactions within the elevator system to reduce elevators movements in the buildings and service time for users. 

The code is implemented in c++.
